BANKEX Crypto Wallet is a free, secure and useful Ethereum wallet for Android-based mobile devices

BANKEX Crypto-wallet allows you to keep, send and receive your crypto-assets. 
BANKEX Crypto-wallet is the best way to interact with Ethereum smart contracts via your mobile device safely. 

BANKEX Crypto-wallet has a native API and uses BANKEX Web3swift library to work with a blockchain. 
A digital signature of transactions is also used and the library itself stores the keys. Moreover, the private key will never derive the function limits of the library and it is erased after each transaction so that it can't be recovered from memory even if there are jailbreaks and root rights.

# Current functionality
